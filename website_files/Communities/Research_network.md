# STACK Researchers Network

The STACK Researchers Network brings together education researchers with an interest in computer-aided assessment tools such as STACK.

The range of topics for research involving STACK is very broad. A recent collaborative project to develop a research agenda for e-assessment in undergraduate mathematics has identified 55 research questions, many of which are relevant to STACK: [https://maths.github.io/e-assessment-research-agenda/](https://maths.github.io/e-assessment-research-agenda/)

The STACK Researchers Network aims to:

* Support the development of new research projects related to STACK, by stimulating interaction between researchers and other professionals using STACK.
* Provide support for colleagues who are seeking to develop skills in education research related to STACK.
* Promote research outcomes from studies involving STACK.

If you would like to join the Network, please contact George Kinnear (G.Kinnear@ed.ac.uk).
