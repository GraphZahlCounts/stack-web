# American Institute of Mathematics meeting: Open source mathematics curriculum and assessment tools

Juma Zevick

### Introduction

The recent Workshop on Open Source Mathematics Curriculum and Assessment Tools, held from August 5 to 9, 2024, at Maseno University, Kisumu, Kenya, brought together a diverse group of educators, researchers, and technologists. Organized by Joe Champion, Franca Hoffmann, Michael Obiero, and Mary Ochieng, and sponsored by the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the workshop aimed to enhance the utility and impact of open educational technologies such as [STACK](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_stack), in the field of mathematics. The event also served as a precursor to the [International STACK Conference at the Technical University of Kenya](https://stack-assessment.org/Events/2024-08-12-AfricanSTACKConference/), starting on August 12, 2024.

### Workshop Overview
The workshop was designed to foster collaboration between creators of open-source educational tools and mathematics education researchers. With a focus on improving the effectiveness and integration of these tools into educational curricula, the event offered a platform for participants to share their experiences, challenges, and innovations.


#### Key Objectives:

1. Enhancing Integration: Discussing strategies for better integration of open-source tools with existing educational frameworks.
2. Research Collaboration: Facilitating partnerships between developers and researchers to drive innovation and practical application.
3. Data Sharing and Analysis: Exploring new avenues for sharing and analyzing educational data to improve learning outcomes.
4. Interoperability: Addressing the technical challenges of ensuring that different educational technologies can work together seamlessly.
5. Implementation Challenges: Identifying common obstacles in the adoption and effective use of these tools, and proposing solutions.


### Key Sessions and Discussions

###### Integration of Math Education Research and Technology
One of the most recurring themes was the need for closer collaboration between technologists, mathematics educators (teachers) and researchers. Participants emphasized that successful integration of technology into mathematics education requires tools that not only align with curriculum standards but also adapt to the diverse needs of students. A significant portion of this discussion focused on the use of the STACK (System for Teaching and Assessment using a Computer algebra Kernel) assessment system, developed by Chris Sangwin, which exemplifies how technology can be effectively integrated into mathematics education. STACK's adaptability and the ability to provide immediate feedback make it a valuable tool in aligning educational technology with curriculum goals. Discussions highlighted the potential for research to inform the development of more intuitive and effective tools, such as STACK, and stressed the importance of iterative feedback loops between users and developers.

###### Data Sharing and Analysis
Another critical topic was the need for safety an sharing data and adaptation of materials shared, such as STACK questions, to ensure contextual relevance across diverse educational settings. The discussions sessions emphasized how data from various educational platforms can be shared, analyzed, and utilized to inform teaching strategies and enhance student performance. Participants explored models for secure and ethical data sharing, including the use of collaborative platforms like GitHub for authoring and sharing materials, with a particular focus on the transparency and community involvement that are essential in the context of open-source tools.


###### Interoperability of Learning Platforms
During the workshop, another key topic of discussion was the interoperability of various educational technologies to support mathematics education. Several participants shared their challenges in integrating tools like STACK into their existing Learning Management Systems (LMS). The workshop underscored the need for standardized protocols and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure that different educational tools can work together seamlessly. Establishing these standards is crucial for creating flexible, scalable solutions that can be customized to meet the diverse needs of educational environments.
By focusing on interoperability, the workshop aimed to address technical barriers and promote the development of cohesive learning platforms. This approach is vital for enabling educators to integrate various technologies, like STACK, into a unified system that enhances both teaching and learning experiences. The goal is to streamline the adoption of educational tools and ensure that they function harmoniously within a broader educational framework, ultimately benefiting students and educators alike.

###### Addressing Shared Implementation Challenges
The workshop also provided a forum for participants to discuss common challenges in implementing open-source tools. These included technical issues, such as compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as human factors, such as resistance to change and the need for professional development. The discussions emphasized the importance of community support and collaboration in overcoming these challenges.

### Outcomes and Future Directions
The workshop concluded with several key recommendations and plans for future actions:
1. Formation of a Collaborative Network: Establish a network of educators, researchers, and developers to address the challenges identified during the workshop. This network aims to drive the adoption of open-source tools like STACK and ensure they are effectively integrated into educational practices.

2. Development of Best Practice Guidelines: Create comprehensive guidelines for integrating technology, such as STACK, into mathematics education. These guidelines will help educators and developers ensure that innovations are both pedagogically sound and practically effective, drawing on insights from the use of STACK in diverse educational settings.

3. Enhanced Data Sharing Protocols: Implement models for secure and ethical data sharing, particularly for tools like STACK. This includes using platforms such as GitHub to author and share STACK questions and materials transparently, facilitating collaboration and improving educational outcomes.

4. Standardized Interoperability Protocols: Develop and promote standardized protocols and APIs to enhance the interoperability of educational technologies, including STACK. This will help create flexible and scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and other educational tools.

5. Addressing Implementation Challenges: Identify and tackle common challenges in adopting open-source tools like STACK, including technical compatibility issues and resistance to change. Emphasize the importance of community support, professional development, and iterative feedback loops to improve the integration of STACK and similar tools.
