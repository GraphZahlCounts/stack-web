## Upcoming conferences

The annual meetings of the STACK Community are for all STACK users to exchange experiences, ideas and research topics.
From 2024 it is likely we will have international community meetings in Europe and Africa.

**2024** [JSXGraph conference 2024](https://jsxgraph.org/conf2024/) will take place on 8th-10th October 2024 at University of Bayreuth, Germany.
The conference will bring together developers and teachers, instructors and designers who are interested or already experienced in using JSXGraph to enhance digital learning of STEM topics. As in the years before, the conference will be an entirely online conference. All participants are required to register, registration is free.

We invite all participants to contribute a talk or workshop and

- report about their concepts, experience, and workflow,
- present their applications and best practices,
- discuss pedagogical concepts involving JSXGraph.

The 5. International JSXGraph Conference 2024 will be organized by the ["Center of Mobile Learning with Digital Technology"](https://mobile-learning.uni-bayreuth.de/)
